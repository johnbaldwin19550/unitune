           This string-array is the heart of the app's resources.
           Feel free to edit it as you like, but be warned that the app
           might not work correctly if you do, so let me explain the syntax:
           There are four colon-delimited fields per instrument, notated as such:

           instrument name : MIDI pitches of notes : transposition in semitones : amplitude of harmonics

           MIDI pitches are used to represent notes on the chromatic scale with positive integers.  Other
           programs use MIDI pitch as well, so you can find lots of online documentation for converting
           between chromatic note names and MIDI pitches, but for now, just know that A5 (a440) is 69.

           Transposition values represent the difference between an instrument's pitch and concert pitch.
           For example, the trumpet's C is 2 semitones flat of concert C, so it has a transposition
           value of -2.

           The amplitudes of the harmonics are used to approximate a waveform similar to the instrument
           being tuned, without refering to any sound files for reference.  Each instrument is given 64
           harmonics, which represent the amplitudes of whole number multiples of the fundamental pitch.

           The amplitudes of the harmonics are written in hexadecimal notation, with one character
           per value, representing a value anywhere between 0 and 15.  Any of the 64 harmonics beyond the
           length of the field are assumed to be of zero amplitude.
